# ARCHITECTURE RULES

## CORE RULES

CORE = locked  
UX = iterative

Frontend reflects permissions.  
Server enforces permissions.

Read from persisted state.  
Do not repair on display.  
Do not mutate from visualization.

Render displays.  
Validation detects.  
Persistence stores.  
Migration transforms.

No business mutation logic in:
- shell
- workspace header
- CRM drawer
- kanban
- palette
- visualization layers

---

# CURRENT PRODUCT POSITION

The system is no longer:
- PDF generator
- travel admin panel

The system is now:
Operational Travel OS

Current layers:
- Workspace
- CRM Context
- Audit Layer
- Capability Layer
- Agency Scope
- Navigation Memory
- QA Runtime
- Operational Visualization

---

# MULTI-AGENCY CONTRACT

Order:

Identity
-> Agency Scope
-> Role Capability
-> Data Access
-> Audit
-> UI Reflection

Rules:
- routes never self-scope
- routes never hardcode role checks
- routes use capabilities
- routes use centralized scope helpers

---

# ROLE CAPABILITY MODEL

Routes DO NOT check:
if role === admin

Routes DO:
requireCapability("offers.update")

Capabilities are server-defined.

Frontend only reflects capability state.

---

# AUDIT CONTRACT

Protected mutation flow:

capability
-> agency scope
-> mutation
-> audit event
-> writeDb

Audit events include:
- agencyId
- userId
- role
- capability
- entityType
- entityId
- timestamp

---

# BOUNDARY TESTING

Boundary tests exist:
scripts/v9-boundary-test.js

Test DB isolation:
DB_FILE env override

Boundary guarantees:
- no cross-agency offer access
- no cross-agency client access
- no cross-agency activity access
- no unauthorized mutation
- workspace/client/palette are scoped

---

# IMPORTANT

This is a long-running operational software project.

Priority:
stability > architecture > audit > boundaries > UX polish > new features

Avoid:
- uncontrolled rewrites
- scattered permissions
- runtime mutation in visualization
- feature chaos

Maintain:
- centralized contracts
- deterministic shell behavior
- scoped data access
- audit consistency
- QA discipline
